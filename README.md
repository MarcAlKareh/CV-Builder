# CV-Builder
This web application is aimed at low income migrants in the UAE. Many of them pay a lot of money to someone to get their CV built, and end up getting scammed. This web application makes it easier for those people to get a basic CV made for them by getting a few key points of information about them. It utilises the OpenAI API in some sections of the application to assist the user if they need help.
